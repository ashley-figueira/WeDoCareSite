###Landing page for the WeDoCare Android application.

###You can check out this website at https://wedocare.dei.uc.pt

This website contains information on the developed application, some screenshots, a contact section so anybody can e-mail the responsible for the application to ask for the code of the project for academic purposes for example. This website was developed using the traditional tools for web development, that is, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also used various libraries to make the development process easier. Libraries used were: Bootstrap, jQuery, wOw.js, owl carousel, animate and font-awesome.
This website resulted in a functional and appealing website with a well-defined objective. The structure of the page is based on HTML5 and is easily adaptable to include different contents (for example, text, photo, video). It has a well defined style using CSS3 and includes some dynamic and interactive elements produced through JavaScript or through external libraries. We focused on quality, organization and validity of code, visual coherence, interactivity, usability and responsiveness. 
We concluded the development of this website with a form in PHP for sending e-mail and added email validation. We also established which fields are required.
